Data: https://api.jsonbin.io/b/6023a4c93b303d3d964e8ddf

Using the simple json that contains a list of hearing aid devices, and the mobile/desktop mockups provided above.


### Behaviour :
- Each button should be clickable and will have an active state (stay active) when selected;
- On click, the image & text in the header should change - according to the data fetched from the provided json file;
- The active selection should be appened to a URL parameter: ‘aud_device’. The value of this active paramter should be the key of each device (ex:aud_device=ricS);
- Only one 'aud_device' parameter should be in the url.  So when more than one button has been clicked only the last one clicked should be in the parameter.
- You can choose the mobile / desktop breakpoints.

### Acceptance criteria:
- Vanilla Js (no frameworks);
- Cross-browser optimised (page should work correctly in all browsers).

### Bonus points (optional):
- Use SCSS;
- Animate the transition between elements;
